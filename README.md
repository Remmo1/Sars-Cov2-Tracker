### Sars-Cov2-Tracker 

I created this aaplication to track actual Covid-19 status worldwide. I used https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv to take actual data. This simple table shows how many new cases we have every day. Furthermore, it shows global amount of new cases.

[Let's see how this application works!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieCOQj9DlnE)

And look at the screens.
